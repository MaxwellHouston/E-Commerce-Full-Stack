                <p>My name is Max Houston, and I am an aspiring software engineer. I’m currently finishing up the Codecademy Full-Stack engineering course and looking for more opportunities to grow. 
                I’m proficient in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, Express, Node.js, and SQL. Using these skills I have created several projects which can be seen on <a href="#">my website</a>. 
                Moving forward I plan on learning PHP, Python and other import languages in order to showcase my skills and land a job in the computer programing industry.
